# Traffic Simulation using concurrency in C++

<img src="data/traffic_simulation.gif"/>

This traffic simulator tries to simulate a real world traffic scenario. The cars arrives in random fashion at traffic lights and controls there behaviour accordingly to avoid accidents at intersections. This project uses thread safe communication protocol between vehicles and intersections to complete simulation.
